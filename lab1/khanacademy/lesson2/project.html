        <h1>Travel to the Arashiyama Bamboo Forest, Japan</h1>
        <h2 class="something">About place</h2>
        <p id="infa"><strong>One of the <em>most</em> visited places in Japan.</strong> Arashiyama is a bamboo field where all the bamboo trees are located at almost the same distance, so they form a dense landscape of different shades of green.</p>
        <h2 class="something">Location of Arashiyama and its climate</h2>
        <img src="https://konnichiwa.ru/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_2023-08-05_200723991.png"alt="climate and location" width="300">
        <p>This area of Kyoto is in the far west of the city at the foot of the Arashiyama Mountains (from 嵐 arashi "thunderstorm" and 山 yama "mountain"). So, literally translated, this word means “thunderstorm mountains”, from which the area got its name. Arashiyama is also surrounded by the Katsura River. Arashiyama is accessible by any public transport, but due to the remoteness of the area from the center of Kyoto, a trip by bus, train or taxi will take about 30 minutes. You can go to Arashiyama at any time of the year, because it is beautiful in every season. In spring, Arashiyama is famous for its beautiful views of cherry blossoms. Summers in the area can be hot and humid. The rainy season begins in June-July, and in August there is intense heat. Also, between June and October there are a lot of mosquitoes. In autumn, you can enjoy the vibrant colors of the tree leaves on the mountains and hills surrounding Arashiyama. During the winter months (December and January), temperatures drop to almost freezing and it can snow in Arashiyama.</p>

        <p>This area is famous not only for its picturesque views, a large number of shrines, but also for its <em>sweets</em>. Basically it's ice cream. In Arashiyama it is not only very tasty, but also unusual. There are options that include matcha, chestnut, black sesame, red beans and even tofu!<br>
Shinpachi Chaya (新八茶屋) is a famous ice cream shop located near Togetsukyo Bridge. The cold treat from this store took 3rd place in the International Ice Cream Competition held in Italy in 2010. Guests are offered a variety of ice cream flavors, such as lemon (lemon sherbet), sakuramochi (mochi with azuki paste wrapped in pickled sakura leaf), marshmallow and soda, strawberry with cookies, tofu and various new items from the seasonal menu.<br>
It's also common to try traditional sweets in Arashiyama, such as matcha mochi or dango.<br>
So, we can say with confidence that Arashiyama is a place of amazing natural beauty, which will take more than one day to contemplate, and traditional and modern Japanese sweets will definitely not leave anyone indifferent.</p>
